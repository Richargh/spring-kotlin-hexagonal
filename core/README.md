## About DI


This is extremely abbreviated but I think it gets the point across:
>  **It turns out we didn't need Dependency Injection containers after all** 
> [...] the lack of a main() method for 1998’s J2EE technologies was the root cause of an entire side industry in Java. [...]
> I (among others) was wrong to shove DI containers down people’s throats in 2002, and Inversion of Control containers from 2000, onwards.
> Dependency Injection c ontainers were a solution to a proximate cause. 
> **The root cause problem being that J2EE apps didn’t have primordial entry points where you could compose everything.**
